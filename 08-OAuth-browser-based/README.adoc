= 8. OAuth - Browser-Based App

== Task

Design and implement a simple OAuth - Browser-Based App. Browser-based apps run entirely in the browser after loading the source code from a web page.  

* Use a simple server (https) for serving static content (html, js, ...).
* Configure any OAuth application of your choice.
    * You can use any OAuth solution as authorization and resource server: http://docs.fit.cvut.cz/[Google], GitHub, ...
* The app in browser connects to the authorization server and allows access to the resources.
* The app collects an presents in the browser any resource from the resource server using the provided code/token (e.g. list of contacts, files, messages, repositories, ...)
* Do not use any OAuth library (e.g. GoogleAuth, ...)

== Solution

First, I created an HTTP2 server that hosts all files, including:
  - **index.html** - page with authorization button

image::./results/app.png[app]
  
- **googleDriveFiles.html** - page displaying a content of users google drive

image::./results/data.png[data]

- **googleClient.js** - script responsible for fetching and displaying the google drive data

- **style.css** - just basic styling

I created the index page and registered the app in https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard[Google Developer Console]. Additionally, I added myself as a test user.

After that, I developer the client, where the user is redirected after authorizing the app using the following dialog.

The client receives an access token through the URL, which can be used to retrieve information about files stored in a user's Google Drive. I made titles clickable and differentiated between files and folders using icons.
