= 2. AJAX and XHR states

== AJAX overview

- Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
- technique for creating better, faster, and more interactive web applications
- relies on XML, JSON, HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- AJAX is not a programming language

== XMLHttpRequest (XHR)

* Interface to utilize HTTP protocol in JavaScript
* standardized by W3C

* methods and properties of XHR object
** *open*, opens the request, parameters:
*** *method* – method to be used (e.g. GET, PUT, POST),
**** *url* – url of the resource,
**** *asynch* – true to make asynchronous call,
**** *user, pass* – credentials for authentication.
** *onReadyStateChange* – JavaScript function object, it is called when readyState changes (uninitialized, loading, loaded, interactive, completed).
** *send, abort* – sends or aborts the request (for asynchronous calls)
** *status, statusText* – HTTP status code and a corresponding text.
** *responseText, responseXML* – response as text or as a DOM document (if possible).
** *onload* – event listener to support server push.


== Tasks

* Create a simple HTML page with an info text field and a single button
* Implement a JavaScript function which is triggered when the button is clicked
** The function should fetch relatively large file (e.g. 100-200MB)
** in the text field show following states:
*** loading - when the open method was called
*** loaded - when the send method was called
*** downloading - while the data is being downloaded
*** finished downloading - when the data has beeen downloaded
* you can use Promise, async/await
